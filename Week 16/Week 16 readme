This course taught me all about MVC. I learned that the model is where your logic goes. The controller determines where 
that logic is sent and how it is used on the view, which is what the user sees and is their interface. I learned different ways to 
style using bootstrap and other techniques. This type of styling and creating different elements of a functional webpage
stressed the importance of readability and having a user friendly interface.

The style changes that I made in this lab are mostly in the layout.cshtml file and the changes I made are related to the
navbar. I changed the color of the navbar to match the color of the jumbotron. This involved making the background
the primary color an changing the text to white. I also added a search input box to the navbar. When the window is shrunk to a 
smaller view, it now says menu, directing the user to the options available in the navbar. I also centered the text on the about page 
to help with readability.

Three things I would like to include in my application are
1. Adding a POS where customers could checkout what they found and purchased. 
2. Adding images. Images are helpful to the viewer. I attempted to add a brand logo in the very left of the nav bar but for
some reason the image wouldn't load properly when I would load the webpage.
3. Adding logic to make the search bar functional.
I don't know how I would make these changes. I feel that it would involve advanced programming skills that I yet to possess.
What I would like changed most is for this course to be longer so that I could develope the skills neccessary to make these 
changes. Even after this course I will continue my studies to build on this application. This application provides a great template
for future use.

This course has been great and super helpful. I now feel confident in MVC and this has been a great addition to my C# skills.
Thank You for a great semester.
