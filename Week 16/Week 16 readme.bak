This course taught me all about MVC. I learned that the model is where your logic goes. The controller determines where 
that logic is sent and how it is used on the view, which is the last part of the MVC. I learned different ways to style
using bootstrap and other techniques. This type of styling and creating different elements of a functional webpage
stressed the importance of readability and having a user friendly interface.

The style changes that I made in this lab are mostly in the layout.cshtml file and the changes I made are related to the
navbar. I changed the color of the navbar to match the color of the rest of the file. This involved making the background
the primary color. I also added a search input box to the navbar. When the window is shrunk to a smaller view, it now
says menu, directing the user to the options available in the navbar. I also centered the text on the about page to help
with readability.
