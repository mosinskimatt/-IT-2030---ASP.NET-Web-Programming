This lab was difficult for me. For starters, the frameework that I was using was not compatible with the nuget packages that I needed to use,
so I had to figure out how to switch the framework and then update the nuget packages. It turns out it wasn't that had. You just have to right click the solution, 
select properties, change the framework and run the application.
