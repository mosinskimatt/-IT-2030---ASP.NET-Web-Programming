In lab 7 I found that the tip calculator model had errors, CS1002. This error was a syntax error and occured becuase there was not a semicolon at the end of line 16.
There was also an spelling error in the site.css file. Width was spelled wrong (widht) in line 13.
There was also an error in the index.cshtml file on line 23. It was a syntax error where @viewbag.Twentyfive was spelled TwentyFeve and could not communicate with the controller. The other viewbag elements on the page were spelled wrong as well.
Making sure your variable types are the same is crucial.
When the lab was calculating the incorrect tip amount, I deleted the method that was causing this and wrote my own methods to be called by the controller to calculate the proper amounts for the tip.
